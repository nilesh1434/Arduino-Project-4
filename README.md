Project 4 - More complicated input and output

1. This code is supposed to turn the lights on and off dependeing on the amount of light that is being given to the photoresistor. If it's dark, then all lights will glow, else one LED light will turn off depending on the brightness increased.

2. It also consists of a potentiometer to controll the loudness of the buzzer attached to it.
